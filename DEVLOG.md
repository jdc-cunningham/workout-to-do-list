It is so brutal to make this, I don't know why.
I have this like shear hatred I don't want to make it.
But I want to stick to this plan, I've started counting calories, second day in a row I've done a "brisk walk" (minor workout).
I just feel like dog shit idk why. Someone stepped on me and rubbed me off on a rock on the side of a curb.

Got over a major part which is making the database/made most of the API endpoints.
Still have some work to do, the interface in particular and then bridging everything.
I was not able to complete everything today though... I dumped just over 2 hours into this, was recording it too but the recording didn't come out correctly(only recorded 1 frame rest was the audio).
