I had some plans with week number grouping and what not... but I guess JS does not have an "expectedly works/clean" way to obtain that like JavaScript. Anyway I'm mostly just reducing complexity. Can pull this data out from a date time. Unfortunately messes up the front end/will have to adjust it. Working on linking the UI with the API right now.

Well I completely blew up the front end, was expecting data to be grouped in another way, staring at red walls right now. Will have to fix next time I work on this.

It is so brutal to make this, I don't know why.
I have this like shear hatred I don't want to make it.
But I want to stick to this plan, I've started counting calories, second day in a row I've done a "brisk walk" (minor workout).
I just feel like dog shit idk why. Someone stepped on me and rubbed me off on a rock on the side of a curb.

Got over a major part which is making the database/made most of the API endpoints.
Still have some work to do, the interface in particular and then bridging everything.
I was not able to complete everything today though... I dumped just over 2 hours into this, was recording it too but the recording didn't come out correctly(only recorded 1 frame rest was the audio).
